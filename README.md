## 1. file_management.py

**Description:**  
Demonstrates file creation from a binary tree and vice versa.

## 2. String Rearrangement

**Description:**  
You are given a string `str`. Your task is to rearrange the characters in `str` such that no two adjacent characters are the same. If it is possible to achieve such a rearrangement, return any valid rearranged string. If it is not possible, return an empty string "".

## 3. Implement the LRUCache Class

**Description:**  
Implement the LRUCache class:

- **LRUCache(int capacity)**: Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
- **int get(int key)**: Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
- **void put(int key, int value)**: Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in O(1) average time complexity.
